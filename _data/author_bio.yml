author_bio: I like the research part of web development. When I research into new learnings and implement them to my project. It gives me chills and also there is indefinite amount to explore and I am an inquisitive man. I also love to sketch, click photograpghs, read quality books and play football in my free time(Lionel Messi's fan).
